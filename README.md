//TASK//üë©‚Äçüíª

Develop a small web application that lets manage the list of showcased works for a digital worker.
An entry can be hidden from the portfolio and can have a link to its customer's website:

1. UI/UX design: Design the user interface and user experience of the application to make it visually appealing and easy to use.

2. Data Modeling: Define the data structure and relationships for the portfolio entries.

3. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations: Implement functionality for adding, editing, and removing entries from the portfolio.

4. Portfolio display: Develop the functionality to display the portfolio entries in a list or grid format.

5. Image Upload: Implement functionality to allow the user to upload images for each portfolio entry.

6. Hide/Unhide entries: Implement functionality to hide or unhide a portfolio entry from being displayed.

7. Customer link: Implement functionality to include a link to the customer's website for each portfolio entry.

8. Responsiveness: Ensure the application is responsive and looks good on different devices and screen sizes.

9. Testing: Perform thorough testing of the application to ensure it is functioning as expected.

In short, the following tasks are needed to make your entry valid:

1. Use Angular/React/Vue CLI to create a new project and define at least a component.
2. Create a model to represent a showcased work's details.
3. Display the list of works using an ngFor directive.
4. Add the functionality to add a new work using a form.
5. Add the functionality to edit an existing work.
6. Add the functionality to delete an existing work.
